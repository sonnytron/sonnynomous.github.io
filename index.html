    <h2>Updating the Site</h2>
    <h3>10/24/2016</h3>
    <p>So a lot of stuff happened and I kind of put this on pause, but now I'm going to pick it up again. Hopefully, I'll make it into a tech blog and document my challenges as I beat them. But we'll see.</p>

    <h2>GRE and Me</h2>
    <p>How much time is there in a day? Well, when you take out nearly an hour for getting up, showering, walking the dog and driving to work, you have 9 hours for work. Now add 8 hours of sleep, an hour to drive home and have dinner and walk the dog again, and you're at 18 hours. No big deal right? There's still six hours left! Well, my goal is to get at least 1.5 hours of study in every day toward the GRE so my girlfriend and I can sail off into the sunset of my graduate study next year. The only problem is, I haven't studied or read anything in an academic context in almost two years. So my goal is, to integrate studying the GRE with my development work and personal projects. So my first app tutorial will be a simple GRE quiz. Wish me luck!</p>

    <h2>1080 or Bust?</h2>
    <p>The GTX 1080 has just been announced, along with some tests and benchmarks. The thing is, we have no idea whether or not the Founder's Edition will be the only one available at the launch date. Until some vendor versions are announced and possibly tested, it's really hard to gauge the value of the card. I'm excited for what summer will bring!</p>

    <h2>Swift? I Objectively C You</h2>
    <p>I've been on the fence about adopting Swift as my primary language for quite some time. The things that bother me are that the language is constantly being updated. Whatever you write/learn now, will drastically change within a year. I feel as though the language itself should stabilize so that developers are less surprised by dynamic architecture changes. But with Swift 3 on the horizon and my new job teaching me Swift for client work, I might need to change my views Swiftly.</p>

    <h2>It's Time for Something Different</h2>
    <p>It's time that I take my blogging and writing a lot more seriously. I need a way to catalog my growth as an engineer and professional, and it's really hard to kind of just "remember" what you've done. At a certain point, it becomes necessary to keep a log of everything you do, and all the things you think about. That way, some time later, you can look back at what you've done and think, "Man, what the fuck was I <em>thinking</em>?" Well Sonny, "Not much", apparently.</p>
